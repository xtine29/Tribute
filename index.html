					Amelia Mary Earhart was born on July 24, 1897 in Atchison, Kansas. On January 3, 1921 she took her first flying lesson and after 6 months, she had saved enough money to buy her first plane and named it "The Canary". Earhart was one of the world's most celebrated aviators and was the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean.
					<br>
					Above all, Earhart was determined and ready to be known as the first woman to fly around the world. yet tragedy struck Earhart on one of her flight and had disappeared on July 2, 1937. After 17 days, the attempt to locate her remains were reluctantly called off by the government. A year after the incident, a Light House was built in her memory on the island she was supposed to go.
